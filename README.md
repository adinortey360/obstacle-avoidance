<h1>Obstacle Avoidance</h1>
<p>A 2D simulation that teaches objects to avoid obstacles using genetic algorithms.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This project uses genetic algorithms to simulate the behavior of objects on a 2D canvas. The objects learn to avoid obstacles in their path by adjusting their movement based on their success in previous generations. The project includes controls in the <code>brain.js</code>, <code>carEntity.js</code>, and <code>script.js</code> files for adjusting the simulation parameters, such as the number of objects and the rate of mutations. The simulation also includes a background image and collision detection to make the environment more realistic.</p>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Clone the repository:
  <pre><code>git clone https://github.com/adinortey360/obstacle-avoidance.git</code></pre></li>
  <li>Open the <code>index.html</code> file in a web browser to run the simulation.</li>
  <li>Use the controls in the <code>brain.js</code>, <code>carEntity.js</code>, and <code>script.js</code> files to adjust the simulation parameters and see how the objects learn to avoid obstacles.</li>
